Projects:
  NKNK: "A Python CLI that runs in between your terminal and the CLI, supports command completion, inline Python, and Python function shortcuts, git integration, and zoxide integration. This is my favorite project."
  Ghscraper: "Collects data on a GitHub user by cloning all their repos, searching commit logs for email leaks, and checks for API/name leaks. To protect idiots from doxxing. Or doxxing idiots, your choice."
  DSH: "Shell scripting for the Flipper Zero. Uses a serial connection to interpret its own programming language. Can use Flipper CLI commands, as well as local Python, and JavaScript. Or anything else you want."
  Papaya: "An unholy creation that allows you to write Python scripts without using parentheses."
